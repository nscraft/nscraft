Goal: Learn Python skills, specifically pandas and plotly - Long term, I believe that having skills in Python will be a gateway for me to much larger and broader projects. There is more I could continue to learn with the tools I already know, but I can already see that I am approaching a plateau in project application. Plotly and Dash offer a vehicle for me to transfer my data visualization experience to a new platform and through practice with these libraries, I will improve my Python code. I can also take advantage of the opportunity to partner with a real business in need of these skills. My current job has not adopted Python or other advanced analytics, so my growth will be stifled if I don't branch out. Thankfully, I am lucky enough to have a willing mentor in another organization. By 12/26/2024 (a year from today) I aim to have enough skill in Python development that my mentor can give me full responsibility for a data visualization project.
