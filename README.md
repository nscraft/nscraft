About Me:

I started my journey in data analysis circa 2019 when I made the jump from my previous career in mental healthcare delivery. I quit my job so I could go to school full time and finally finish my bachelor's degree (Human Services @ Notre Dame de Namur University). I learned that I didn't want to continue to deliver healthcare services, but I still had a passion for helping people find insights to help them achieve their goals.
After some searching, I took a job at with a charter school network in their talent department, where my primary role was helping to coordinate the recruiting team. I fell in love with data discovery and very quickly, I did everything I could to devote the minimum amount of time to my other job duties so that I could get back to analyzing data. This is also where I got my first exposure to Power BI which inspired me to learn more tools. Most importantly, it's where I found data peers outside of my department and gained a mentor. After that, the momentum continued to build and to this day I still love learning new methods, technologies and best practices.
