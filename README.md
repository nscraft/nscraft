About Me:

I started my journey in data analysis circa 2019 when I made the jump from my previous career in mental healthcare delivery. I quit my job so I could go to school full time and finally finish my bachelor's degree (Human Services @ Notre Dame de Namur University). I learned that I didn't want to continue to deliver healthcare services, but I still had a passion for helping people find insights to help them achieve their goals.
After some searching, I took a job at with a charter school network in their talent department, where my primary role was helping to coordinate the recruiting team. I fell in love with data discovery and very quickly, I did everything I could to devote the minimum amount of time to my other job duties so that I could get back to analyzing data. This is also where I got my first exposure to Power BI which inspired me to learn more tools. Most importantly, it's where I found data peers outside of my department and gained a mentor. After that, the momentum continued to build and to this day I still love learning new methods, technologies and best practices.

Project Portfolio:


12/26/2023

Goal:

Learn Python skills, specifically pandas and plotly - Long term, I believe that having skills in Python will be a gateway for me to much larger and broader projects. There is more I could continue to learn with the tools I already know, but I can already see that I am approaching a plateau in project application. Plotly and Dash offer a vehicle for me to transfer my data visualization experience to a new platform and through practice with these libraries, I will improve my Python code. I can also take advantage of the opportunity to partner with a real business in need of these skills. My current job has not adopted Python or other advanced analytics, so my growth will be stifled if I don't branch out. Thankfully, I am lucky enough to have a willing mentor in another organization. By 12/26/2024 (a year from today) I aim to have enough skill in Python development that my mentor can give me full responsibility for a data visualization project.
